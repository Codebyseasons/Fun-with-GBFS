1. File: main.tf
This appears to be a Terraform configuration file. Although its contents are not displayed here, Terraform files (.tf) typically define infrastructure resources and configurations for cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

Common elements in such files:

Providers: Define the cloud provider to use (e.g., provider "aws" {}).
Resources: Specify the infrastructure components to create (e.g., VMs, databases, or networks).
Variables: Allow parameterization for reusable configurations.
Outputs: Provide information after execution, such as IPs or resource IDs.
To document this file:

Purpose: Identify the infrastructure components and their roles.
Key Elements: Highlight any variables, resources, or outputs.
Usage: Include instructions on running this configuration (e.g., terraform init, terraform apply).

2. File: sql.sh
This is a Bash script for managing and interacting with a PostgreSQL database, retrieving API data, and storing it into the database.

Main Functions:

Secrets Retrieval: Fetches database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager.
Database Initialization: Creates tables (api_data, historical_data) to store API information and historical logs.
API Data Processing:
Fetches data from multiple APIs.
Updates the last_updated field in the database.
Stores historical data for reference.
Reusable Helper Functions: Handles database queries, fetches JSON data from APIs, and manages database connections.
Key APIs Included:

Bird Basel
Ridedott Brussels
Neuron YCC

Usage: Instructions to execute (e.g., bash sql.sh).
Dependencies: List required tools (AWS CLI, PostgreSQL, jq, etc.).
Environment Variables: Include required configurations (e.g., AWS credentials, database endpoint).
Error Handling: Document failure cases (e.g., secret retrieval failure).

3. File: terraform.tfstate and terraform.tfstate.backup
These are Terraform state files, which track the current state of the deployed infrastructure. They are essential for:

Synchronizing State: Ensure Terraform knows the real-world infrastructure state.
Collaboration: Share infrastructure status among team members.
Rollback: Act as a backup for potential troubleshooting.

Caution:
These files often contain sensitive data (e.g., credentials or resource identifiers). Avoid sharing them publicly.
Documentation Suggestions:

Purpose: Explain the importance of state files in Terraform operations.
Best Practices: Secure storage (e.g., use Terraform Cloud or remote backends like S3).
Do Not Edit: Warn against manual modifications.
Versioning: Keep backups (like terraform.tfstate.backup) for recovery.


Purpose of Each File
main.tf: Defines the infrastructure as code for resource provisioning.
sql.sh: A script to manage PostgreSQL databases and process data from APIs.
terraform.tfstate and .backup: Terraform state files for tracking infrastructure.
How to Use the Provided Files
Set Up Infrastructure:

Initialize Terraform (terraform init).
Review the configuration in main.tf to understand the infrastructure.
Apply the configuration (terraform apply).
Run the Bash Script:

Install required dependencies (jq, AWS CLI, PostgreSQL tools).
Ensure environment variables and secrets are configured.
Execute sql.sh to initialize the database and process API data.
Manage State Files:

Store terraform.tfstate securely (e.g., encrypt or use a remote backend).
Use terraform plan and terraform apply commands for infrastructure updates.
